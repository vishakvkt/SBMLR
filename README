This is a fork of the SBMLR package originally written by Tom Radivoyevitch(Case western University) used to import SBML models in R. 

The original package was very strict in terms of arrangement of the XML and rarely worked properly with most models available at Bioc.

In this fork, the parser for the most part has been rewritten. Some leeway has been given for parsing dirty XML's too.

The package can also be used to simulate the biological models from within the R environment and perform global sensitivity analysis by computing 
the partial rank correlations of the different parameters of the model.

--Dependencies-----

libxml2 - XML tree creaetor. This can be installed by typing 'library("XML")' without the single quotes within R.
odesolve - Livermore ODE solver. This can be installed by tying 'library("odesolve")' without the single quotes from within R.

----Installation---

Note: These Instructions apply to linux, windows and Mac operating systems.

1) Launch R and install the above packages.

2) close R and then at the prompt, type ' R CMD INSTALL /path/to/SBMLR/download SBMLR'

so for example, if the package was in /home/user/Downloads/SBMLR, you would type

'R CMD INSTALL /home/user/Downloads/SBMLR SBMLR

3) If all goes well, It will give you a success loading message.

4) Launch R. Type 'library(SBMLR)' and It should successfully load the package. You are now free to use the different functions.


----------------

Functions available in SBMLR

readSBML('path/to/model'):

Argument - SBML model file(with extension .xml)
Returns - Equivalent R model object file.

example
model = readSBML('/home/user/model.xml')

saveSBML(R model object, 'path/to/save/model.xml'):

Arguments - Path/to/save - where you want to save the file
	    R model object - the R object you want to save.

Returns - TRUE if successful. False if not.

example

saveSBML(model, '/home/user/some_name.xml')

simulate(model, time series):

Arguments - model: The R model object created using the readSBML function.
	    time_series: The number of minutes you want to perform the simulation. This should be a vector.

Returns - Simulated R object file.

example

simulated = simulate(model, seq(1,60,1))			#here time is a vector sequence from 1 to 60

Thats all for now.
